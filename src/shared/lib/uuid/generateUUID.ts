/*    RFC 4122
      The formal definition of the UUID string representation is
      provided by the following ABNF [7]:

      UUID                   = time-low "-" time-mid "-"
                               time-high-and-version "-"
                               clock-seq-and-reserved
                               clock-seq-low "-" node
      time-low               = 4hexOctet
      time-mid               = 2hexOctet
      time-high-and-version  = 2hexOctet
      clock-seq-and-reserved = hexOctet
      clock-seq-low          = hexOctet
      node                   = 6hexOctet
      hexOctet               = hexDigit hexDigit
      hexDigit =
            "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" /
            "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f" /
            "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"

   The following is an example of the string representation of a UUID as
   a URN:

   urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6 */

export function uuid(): string {
  return 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'.replace(/[xy]/g, function (c) {
    const r = (Math.random() * 16) | 0,
      v = c === 'x' ? r : (r & 0x3) | 0x8;
    return v.toString(16);
  });
}
